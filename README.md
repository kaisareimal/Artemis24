# Artemis24
Website for a store that sells hunting and fishing gear. This is a prototype and probably won't be used. 

This website was created as a thesis for a web design class. 
I used the Bootstrap 5 framework to create the page.

There ar only five screens so the user flow is
index > kalastus > paat mia 410 > ostukorv > ostukorvi kokkuv√µte

The top store logo always takes you back tot he index page.
